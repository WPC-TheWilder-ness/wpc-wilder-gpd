bio: General Peace Dynamics is a nacent peace-based theory of anything, or allthings. Its goal is to provide a lens through which we can make sense of arbitrarily complex phenomena, in terms that are understandable as intuitive to the arbitrary Human being. It imposes a universal principle of the 'world piece computer', which serves to provide meaning to the persist question of 'how', areguably the most difficult and troublesome consideration that haunts modern science, mathematics, philosophy, theology---epistemology as a greater whole.
