![General Peace Dynamics, comprehensive tentative symbolic expression](images/GPDREPRESENTATION.png)

General Peace Dynamics is a nacent peace-based theory of anything, or allthings. Its goal is to provide a lens through which we can make sense of arbitrarily complex phenomena, in terms that are understandable as intuitive to the arbitrary Human being. It imposes a universal principle of the 'world piece computer', which serves to provide meaning to the persist question of 'how', areguably the most difficult and troublesome consideration that haunts modern science, mathematics, philosophy, theology---epistemology as a greater whole.

### NOTE:
The symbolic expression presented is a _representation_ of GPD in terms of core concepts and themes, at the highest level capable of muster. One could view this as an equivalent view of 'the universal piece computer'.

This in part represents one turn in my collaborative conversation with myself, and the piece is nearly comprehensive in its assertion, but in deep terms of GPD itself, which ultimately veers away from purely standard modern physics conceptions of the workings of fundamental reality. Also, this expression is deliberately NOT in terms of the piece computer invokation, and all piece computer notions of peace construction and 'physics manifesting' are implied. Finally, this expression is NOT meant to depict the anything-pieceblob universal (deepest constructive building block within realm of conceivability per GPD).

And yes, expression construction is extremely deliberate, with intent being to remain as faithful as possible to gestalt of notational convention (though I rushed the phi-star...needs improvement, plus indication of the phi-series/phi-potential continuum limit emergent construction framework).

Until I find time to write properly on the physics of GPD in current state of art, consider this functional conceptual art, part of my computational peace process.

And as for symbols themselves, note that GPD postulates (perhaps by definition though not sure yet) that any difference contains a general potential energy that can in principle be harnessed to power useful change. This is Delta strike. And V strike, without getting into definitions (though implied slightly by q,p) is the 'peaceblob quanta superposition', or wavefunction, however have you, and in most basic of all possible q,p perscriptions, V(q,p) is a 'state, q' and 'piece, p', where state implies the Hamiltonian 6-space, time being the second dimension for GPD-characteristic spacetime-timespace conjugate 7-space manifold and cross product interation model (however that works, TBD).
